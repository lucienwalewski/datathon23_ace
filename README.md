## Description

Certain minority stakeholders are often inadvertently overlooked when implemented (government) policies. We provide a web application that takes in a policy in the format of a string, identifies the key stakeholders that may be marginalised and provides a short summary on each of them.

## Setup

- Run `python3 setup.py` to run the backend server. It assumes that the AWS endpoint is running.
- `cd frontend` to navigate to the frontend. Then run `npm install` and `npm start` to install the necessary packages and launch the React frontend.

## Todo

- Fix frontend bugs
- Incorporate generated images of stakeholders next to summaries
